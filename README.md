# Interview Task Maze - Avalon Innovations

Welcome to the `interview-task-maze` project! This project is used to evaluate candidates for web development positions at Avalon Innovations. The application is a simplified Next.js app designed to randomly generate (and possibly solve) 2D mazes.

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to assess your ability to work with common web development tools and concepts such as Next.js, React, Context, Components, and Hooks. You will be asked to extend the existing codebase and implement new features or improve existing ones. This will help us evaluate your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and overall understanding of web development principles.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Start development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Task Instructions

You will receive a set of tasks to complete as part of the interview process. These tasks will involve extending the application, implementing new features, or improving existing ones. Make sure to understand the requirements carefully before proceeding.

## Submission
